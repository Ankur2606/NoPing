Good afternoon. You have three important emails today, two of which are critical and require immediate attention.

First, Ayushman Lakshkar from Leviathan has flagged an urgent need for the final version of the AI/ML model to be reviewed, finalized, and pushed to the repository right away. This is crucial for hitting our deployment timelines. He asks for an update once the push is complete and requests you to flag any issues or dependencies immediately.

Second, there's another critical email from Ayushman regarding a merge conflict on GitHub that’s preventing our deployment. He needs you to address and resolve this conflict as soon as possible. Let him know once it’s fixed or if you need any help.

Moving on to the action item, Bhavya Pratap Singh Tomar from Github Education reached out about hiring for an upcoming AI/ML workshop. They want to know if you're interested in participating or if you can schedule a meeting to discuss further.

That covers everything for now. Focus on resolving the GitHub issues and pushing the AI/ML model first, then reach out to Bhavya about the workshop when you have a moment.
